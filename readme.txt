WP CONTENT PERSONALIZATION: THE #1 WORDPRESS PERSONALISATION PLUGIN
Remember those books where could you choose your own adventure?

[WordPress Content Personalization](https://www.ventureharbour.com/wordpress-content-personalization/) applies the 'choose your own adventure' concept to to website content. You ask your visitors a simple question and the content on your website changes depending on their answer. This improves your message relevance, boosting content engagement and conversions.
Unlike other content personalization tools where you can only display different content based on arbitrary data points like location or device, WordPress Content Personalization allows you to ask the questions that matter the most for you to personalize your content on.

This makes it especially powerfully for marketers wanting to personalize their article content to different customer personas. For example,  you could personalize an article based on the reader's experience level, their budget, company size, requirements or virtually anything else!

Upload the WordPress Content Personalization plugin to your blog, activate it, then navigate to the page or post that you want to personalize.

1. In 'Visual Mode' click the octopus icon above the main content window and insert your first personalisation question. This will open up a modal popup prompting you to add a question and the possible answers.
2. In the same modal, you'll need to define your personalized content blocks - block 1 will display by default and for answer 1, block 2 will display for answer 2 etc.. You can put any content (text, images, HTML) inside this personalized content block.
3. Youâ€™re done! You now have a question in your content that dynamically personalizes content on the page when someone answers it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Who is WordPress Content Personalization built for?**

We built this plugin for content marketing professionals, bloggers, and internet marketers looking to increase their content engagement and conversion rates by displaying more relevant content to their audiences through personalization.

**Does the page need to be refreshed for the content to dynamically update?**
No, all of the personalized content changes in real time when a visitor answers a question. There's no need for the page to refresh.

**Is there a flicker effect or reduction in page loading time?**
No - we use shortcodes to prevent any flicker effect (a major problem with many content personalization platforms that use visual editors) and to keep the plugin as lightweight as possible. While the additional resources may result in a tiny increase in loading time, this is very likely to be justified by the increased engagement & conversions.

**Is there a demo where I can see it in action?**
Yes - we use the plugin on this article on [email marketing software](https://www.ventureharbour.com/email-marketing-software-tools-one-best/). By adding three personalisation questions & content blocks we increased average time on page by 22%, reduced the bounce rate by 9.9%,  and increased the number of people clicking through to an email marketing provider by 88%. Shortly after these improvements, organic search traffic to this article increased by 53% - while it's difficult to directly attribute personalization to this increase, it's likely that the improved engagement was a contributor to this.

**Can I personalize web content based on geolocation, IP,  or device?**
Not yet. We believe that content personalization is more engaging (and less creepy) when it's based on asking visitors a set of questions. Our own experiments have found that this approach increases engagement
